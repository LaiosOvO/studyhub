# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Input a research direction -> get a complete paper landscape with AI-identified gaps -> generate and auto-execute experiment plans that improve on existing work.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Infrastructure & Auth Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Stack confirmed as FastAPI + Next.js + Tauri + Neo4j + Temporal + PostgreSQL + Meilisearch + Valkey + SeaweedFS (MinIO replaced, ClickHouse deferred)
- [Roadmap]: CNKI/Wanfang separated into own phase due to anti-scraping complexity
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3/4 can parallelize (both depend on Phase 2); Phases 6/7 can parallelize (both depend on Phase 5)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CNKI/Wanfang anti-scraping strategies need hands-on testing (Phase 3)
- Tauri-to-web sync protocol needs design research (Phase 8)
- Researcher matching has no benchmark -- will need user feedback loops (Phase 10)
